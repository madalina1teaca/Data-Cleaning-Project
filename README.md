# Titanic Dataset Cleaning Project

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning the Titanic dataset to prepare it for further analysis and predictive modeling regarding passenger survival. The cleaning process involves various steps to ensure that the dataset is well-structured and ready for exploratory data analysis (EDA).

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this project include:
- Handling missing values effectively.
- Removing duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
- Converting data types for appropriate analysis.
- Engineering new features, such as family size and titles from passenger names.
- Identifying and removing outliers to improve data quality.

## Key Steps in the Cleaning Process
1. **Import Libraries**: Utilize necessary libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.
2. **Load the Data**: Load the Titanic dataset from a specified file path.
3. **Initial Data Exploration**: Display basic information and summary statistics of the dataset.
4. **Identifying Missing Values**: Check for missing values in each column.
5. **Handling Missing Values**: Fill or drop missing values appropriately.
6. **Handling Duplicates**: Remove any duplicate rows in the dataset.
7. **Data Type Conversion**: Convert appropriate columns to categorical data types for analysis.
8. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features that may help in predictive modeling.
9. **Removing Unnecessary Columns**: Drop columns that are not useful for analysis.
10. **Outlier Detection**: Identify and remove outliers to enhance the quality of the dataset.
11. **Final Review of the Cleaned Data**: Review the cleaned dataset to ensure it meets the analysis standards.

## Next Steps
Once the dataset is cleaned and prepared, the next phase will involve conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover insights about factors affecting passenger survival rates on the Titanic. This analysis may include visualizing survival rates based on demographic features, fare prices, and other relevant characteristics.
